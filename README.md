## SMS via HTTP \- third generation


</div>

### Description

Forget everything I published at this place before! Here goes a professional solution for sending SMS out of a VB program. I was tired of adapting my program to all those upcoming and declining web sites providing free SMS. Hence I defined a COM interface, which covers the needs of a typical application in terms of sending SMS. Your application runs against this interface and has no clue about the objects implementing the interface. I also provide a couple of COM objects implementing the interface. These COM objects are proxy objects invoking the actual interface of the SMS provider. They do not deliver the messages themselves. Currently there are proxy objects for clickatell, SMSx, ICQ (free), and kSMS (free). Clickatell and SMSx are not free but more reliable. The installer package contained in the ZIP has some prerequisites. Get them from www.klemid.de/vbsms.aspx. Have fun.
